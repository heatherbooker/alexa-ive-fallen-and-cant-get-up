MHacks Feb 2016 Project!

Our hack for Mhacks 2016 is a hardware hack featuring the Amazon Echo. By utilizing the amazon API we built a skill into Alexa (the AI of the device) that will alert medical services if a person is injured or endangered.

We hope this would be used in situations where people would be unable to access a phone or other device due to incompacitation.

This hack is built with python, amazon services, and Twilio.
